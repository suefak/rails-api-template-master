  I've created a Checklist app which is simple yet very effective.
  By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important. And by prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave until late.
  User is able to sign up and sign in, when signed in User is able to create checklist specific to the User. Set the priority of each item, user is also able to update each item and delete at their discretion.

 I was able to get everything functioning in the app (Auth and CRUD actions), but in the very near future I plan on beautifying the app to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
